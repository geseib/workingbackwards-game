## Overview

The Working Backwards Game is an interactive tool for teams to apply cross-disciplinary thinking to their work challenges. Players take turns as the "Bar Raiser" and evaluate how other players apply lessons from different fields to their own work.

## How to Play

### Setup
1. **Books**: Select from the "101 Things I Learned in [Subject] School" series that you have available, or add your own book titles.
2. **Players**: Add the names of all participants and check the boxes for those playing in the current session.

### Gameplay
1. **Start a Round**: Click on the game board to begin. A random player will be chosen as the Bar Raiser, and a random book and lesson number (1-101) will be selected.
2. **Read and Apply**: The Bar Raiser reads the selected lesson aloud. All other players write down how they could apply that lesson to their work.
3. **Share and Evaluate**: Players share their answers, and the Bar Raiser chooses the best response.
4. **Score Points**: The player with the best answer receives a point, tracked at the top of the screen.
5. **Rotate Roles**: The Bar Raiser role rotates to the next player for the next round.

### Winning
The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner!

## The Book Series

The game uses concepts from the acclaimed "101 Things I Learned in [Subject] School" series by Matthew Frederick and various subject matter experts. Each book in this series presents 101 concise lessons that capture essential principles, techniques, and wisdom from different disciplines.

These books are perfect for this game because they:
- Distill complex ideas into accessible, bite-sized lessons
- Cover a wide range of disciplines (Architecture, Engineering, Film School, Law School, etc.)
- Include visual illustrations that help convey concepts
- Present ideas that can be creatively applied across different fields

You can [purchase the books on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P5ZQ8LD?binding=kindle_edition&ref=dbs_m_mng_rwt_sft_tkin_thcv&qid=1740654942&sr=8-1) or at your local bookstore.
